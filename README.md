  <p>The user will have three things to do when he chooses to create an appointment: write the lab that he wants, the time that the lab is going to be in use, and his name(professor's name). </p>

  <p>If someone attempts to schedule a laboratory that is already reserved, a message will appear in the system stating that it is not possible, as the laboratory is currently in use.</p>
